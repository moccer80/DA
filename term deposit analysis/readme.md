This dataset contains information on sales contacts with clients. After obtaining the data, I follow these steps:  
1.Visualize the Data: Begin by visualizing the data to identify patterns and insights.  
2.Data Cleaning: Clean the dataset, addressing missing or incomplete information.  
3.Modeling with Random Forest: Use a Random Forest model to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit, and evaluate the model's performance using a confusion matrix.

In the training data, only 13% of clients chose to subscribe to a term deposit. However, after training the model, the predicted term deposit rate in the test data increases to 48%. This indicates that utilizing this model could significantly enhance the efficiency of sales teams by allowing them to focus their efforts on the most promising leads.
