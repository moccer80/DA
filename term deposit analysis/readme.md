After obtaining the data, I follow these steps:  
1.Visualize the Data: Begin by visualizing the data to identify patterns and insights.  
2.Data Cleaning: Clean the dataset, addressing missing or incomplete information.  
3.Modeling with Random Forest: Use a Random Forest model to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit, and evaluate the model's performance using a confusion matrix.
