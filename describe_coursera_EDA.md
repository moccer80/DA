## Action plan

1. Due to low sales warmers and hot water bottles in spring and summer and rising sales in autumn and winter, reduce inventory in spring and summer to minimize storage and management costs. Increase inventory in autumn and winter to meet higher sales demand. Additionally, since customers preparing to leave the warm indoors for the cold outdoors may want something to keep them warm, set up a winter warm product section near the exit to make it convenient for customers to grab items and boost sales.
2. Christmas items are seasonal and difficult to sell after the holiday. Therefore, before Christmas, bundle popular items with less popular ones and offer discounts. This effectively reduces the price of less popular items, decreasing their inventory while still generating some profit.

## Why I promote these strategy

1. Observing high UK sales in autumn and noting hot water bottles among the top 15 items, I hypothesized increased demand for warming products in autumn and winter. Using keywords like "WARMER" and "HOT WATER," I analyzed sales data. From September to February, 23 of 44 warming products had significantly higher sales, with an average T-value p-value of 0.0569, indicating higher demand in colder months. To optimize inventory and meet customer needs, I proposed targeted strategies.
2. For Christmas products, to avoid excess post-holiday inventory, bundle popular and less popular items, such as the Wooden Heart Christmas Scandinavian, Paper Chain Kit, and Pink Christmas Flock Droplet, into a discounted decoration set to boost sales.
